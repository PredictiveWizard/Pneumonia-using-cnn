Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a pneumonia detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze X-ray images. It includes:

- Model Training: Utilized a CNN model trained on X-ray images to classify them as either 'normal' or 'affected' by pneumonia.
- Flask Web Application: A web application built with Flask that allows users to upload X-ray images and get predictions on whether the image shows signs of pneumonia.
- User Interface: The application provides an intuitive user interface to upload images and display predictions along with accuracy metrics.
- Deployment Ready: The project is structured for easy deployment, with all necessary components and configurations.

Features

- Upload X-ray images for analysis.
- Receive real-time predictions on pneumonia status.
- View uploaded image and prediction results on a user-friendly web page.
